# gtav-audio-occlusion

A tool for generating audio occlusion for V MLOs.

If you don't know what is interior's audio occlusion or how it works on V, I suggest you read the research notes, [Nikez's documentation](https://github.com/nikez/gtav_audio_occlusion_documentation), and the [rage.re topic](https://rage.re/docs?topic=40) about it.

This tool uses the CodeWalker XML format, so you need to extract/import game files with [CodeWalker](https://github.com/dexyfex/CodeWalker) before using the generated files.

## Disclaimer

This tool was made incentivize and make the transition to using [FiveM](https://fivem.net/)'s native audio system easier for the community.

If you're totally unsatisfied with this tool, there is another public audio occlusion tool you can try [here](https://github.com/tangerinenuistance5/OcclusionGenerator).

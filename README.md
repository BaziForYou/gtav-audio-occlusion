# gtav-audio-occlusion

A tool for generating Audio Occlusion for GTA V custom interiors.

The tool reads and writes CodeWalker XML files.

If you don't know how to use the generated files, I suggest you read Nikez's documentation about Audio Occlusion.

Even that you can generate and customize the basics of interior audio, there is still a lot of features missing.

If you feel comfortable, please contribute.
